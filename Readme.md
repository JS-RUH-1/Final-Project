## Overview: 

For your final project, you'll have the choice of building a MERN stack. Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. 

Though, you'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! 

You will be woking as an individual for this project. 

## Prerequisite:
- Select a Project Idea of your own.
- User stories
- Wireframe 
- React Router Routes
- Components
- Models
- Backend routes



## Requirements:

- Build a full stack web application. Must be your own work.
    - back-end: Express, MongoDB  
    - front-end: React, NextJs
    - Connect the backend and frontend through the API
- Have at least 3 models (more if makes sense)
- Add authetication for Users
- Have multiple users roles and authorization for each role 
- Have full CRUD on at least one of your models
- Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models
- Create database and connect it to the project.
- Use the MVC design pattern
- Be deployed on Heroku
- Readme 


## Additional Requirements & Bonus:
- Use a third-party APIs {SMS Message, Google Maps,â€¦. ([Resource](https://any-api.com/), [Resource](http://apis.io/))
- SocketIO ([Resource](https://socket.io/))
- Authorization roles and groups
- Upload the images/files to : 
    - AWS S3 ([Resource](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_ql_prod_st_s3))
    - Cloudinary ([Resource](https://cloudinary.com/)) 
- Make a  React-Native as front-end. 
- Use the unit-test (Mocha,Chai or Jest)


## Necessary Deliverables:
### Projects are due Wednesday, 22/12


- A link to your deployed application
- A link to your github repository
- A link of your presentation 

### The presentation must be a 8-10 minute presentation in which you answer the following questions:

- What is the application about?
- What are the user stories for your application?
- What API did you choose to use?
- Demo of the application
- Walk through a piece of code
- Answer some conceptual questions on your code
- What was the most difficult part of the project?
- What was your favorite part of the project?
- What is the thing your most proud of in the project?
